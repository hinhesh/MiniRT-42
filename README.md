# Raytracing
This implementation is coded in C. It's a 42 Project.
The aim of this project is to create a Raytracing Software.
Raytracing  is a rendering technique for generating 
an image by tracing the path of light as pixels in an image plane 
and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects. 
The technique is capable of producing a high degree of visual realism.

This software works for the moment only on Linux.
To make my software works : 
1) Open your Terminal
2) write on your terminal: "gcl git@github.com:hinhesh/Raytracing.git"
3) write on your terminal: "cd Raytracing"
4) write on your terminal: "make re"
You have some images already premade to be compiled. Per example to compile the first scene: 
5) write on your terminal: "./minirt scenes/scene1-sphere.rt"
